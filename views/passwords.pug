					p.mainBlogText(style="margin-bottom:50px;") Passwords are a very common and talked about cyber security measure, it is the one piece of security that everyone has familiarity with, but how should you create a safe password?<br><br>A safe password is one in which it is difficult for a hacker to calculate, this is why it is vital that passwords are taken under heavier consideration. A password ideally should have between 8 and 16 characters and include numbers and symbols, this is because attacks such as dictionary attacks can easily crack passwords that have dictionary words in them, and placing symbols and numbers in the password adds an extra layer of complexity that has to be found.<br><br>However, despite this, it may not actually be the best idea to create a password like this due to a complex password meaning that it is very difficult to remember, this leads to most people writing their password down either in a notebook, their mobile devices or their computers. This can actually lead to them being more vulnerable from cyber security attacks.<br><br>The best approach to password security is to download one of the many reputable password manager services that are now available, as they can create long and complex passwords for you that will be automatically used when signing into different services, as these services are very secure it is extremely difficult for a hacker to gain access to any of your account passwords.<br><br> <i style="font-size:18px;">As a cautionary note however, make sure that the password manager you use is reputable, otherwise you may be placing 'all your eggs in one basket'</i><br><br>As a conclusion to this article, if you do not want to use a password manager, then make sure that you take your own precautionary password steps, such as adding numbers and symbols and making use of capitalisation, but, otherwise a password manager is the safest way to keep your passwords secure.
